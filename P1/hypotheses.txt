As a part of P1, you will be checking validity of following set of hypothesis on given dataset.
 
A. <knimgao>-<1> A node with higher degree would belong to more number of circles.
B. <amittal>-<1> A circle with a higher density would have a greater degree of intersection with other circles
C. <krege>-<1> In a network, nodes with more common circles have more common features as compared to nodes with less common circles.

Definitions:
Density of circle: the ratio of existing edges within members of the circle to the maximum possible edges within its members.
Circles:  These are social circles, most analogous to groups we have in facebook. Looking into the  data files should give more clarity.
Common circle: For two different users, common circles are the ones to which they belong.

Output Format:
A.
<knimgao>-<1> A node with higher degree would belong to more number of circles.
Check the validity of this hypothesis for Ego Networks of Users : 0 and 348 in your code.
 
Please use following output format for P1:
  
1) For Ego Node 0, your submission should contain output of your program with following CSV columns:
   NodeID, Degree of Node, Number of circles it belongs to
   
   Each row will be related to user in the Ego Node's network.
   NodeID: ID of user,
   Degree of node: Number of edges from this user to other users in the ego network (refer 0.edges file) (EDIT: Refer facebook_combined.txt file as per clarofication posted @29. ) (EDIT2: Use the degree of user from ego network. Hence, use the 0.edges file.)
   Number of circles: In 0.circles file, the number of circles that this user belongs to.
   Also, sort the table in decreasing order of number of circles.
    
2) Repeat the same for Ego Node 348.
     
3) Graph: Include graph of Degree of Nodes vs. Number of circles for both the ego nodes.
   You can use any tool to generate the graph. Programming of graph is not mandatory.
      
       
4) Conclusion and Explanation:
   State whether your findings support or oppose the hypothesis.
   And then briefly explain your conclusion 

B. <amittal>-<1> A circle with a higher density would have a greater degree of intersection with other circles
Check the validity of this hypothesis for Ego Networks of Users : 107 and 686 in your code.

Please use following output format for P1:

1) For Ego Node 107, your submission should contain output of your program with following CSV columns:
Circle Name, Density, Degree of intersection with other circles 

Each row will be related to a circle in 107.circles file.
Circle Name: Circle Name is available as first entry in each row of 107.circles file,
Density: Ratio of existing edges within the members of a circle to the maximum possible edges within member of circle
Degree of intersection with other circles: It is the summation of degree of intersection of this circle with all the other circles.
To calculate degree of intersection between two circles, take the ratio of size of their intersection to the size of their union.
 
 sort the table in decreasing order of density of circle.

 2) Repeat the same for Ego Node 686.
 3) Graph: Include graph of Density vs. Degree of intersection for both the ego nodes.
 You can use any tool to generate the graph. Programming of graph is not mandatory.
 4) Conclusion and Explanation:
 State whether your findings support or oppose the hypothesis.
 And then briefly explain your conclusion

C. <krege>-<1> In a network, nodes with more common circles have more common features as compared to nodes with less common circles.
Check the validity of this hypothesis for Ego Networks of Users : 414 and 698 in your code.

Please use following output format for P1:

1) For Ego Node 414, your submission should contain output of your program with following CSV columns:
NodeID, Number of common circles, Number of common features with ego node

Each row will be related to a user in ego node's network.
NodeID: ID of user,
Number of common circles: From 414.circles file, find the number of circles this user belongs to
Number of common features: Number of common features of this user with the ego user
sort the table in decreasing order of number of common circles.

2) Repeat the same for Ego Node 698.
 
 3) Graph: Include graph of Common Circles vs. Common Features for both the ego nodes.
 You can use any tool to generate the graph. Programming of graph is not mandatory.
  
  4) Conclusion and Explanation:
  State whether your findings support or oppose the hypothesis.
  And then briefly explain your conclusion
